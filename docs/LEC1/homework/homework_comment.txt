Your answers indicate that you have some sense of what the user-level
program does, but not a clear model of what the kernel does.
Mixing shell behavior, argument parsing, and POSIX commentary obscures
the main point: the question is about the kernel’s abstraction, not the
user program’s behavior.

In Q1, you didn’t separate user-level actions from the system call
mechanism. The kernel doesn’t decide anything about “no arguments” or
“keyboard input.” Those are decisions in cat or the shell. The kernel
only maintains a per-process descriptor table; your answer doesn’t state
this.

In Q2, enumerating fd numbers is not an explanation of what a file
descriptor is. The question is asking for the abstraction, not the
conventions.

Overall: effort is visible, but the conceptual boundaries between user
space and kernel space are not yet sharp. Tighten your understanding of
what the kernel actually provides.
