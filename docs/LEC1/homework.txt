For this lecture, read the xv6 implementation of a simple Unix program, cat, available here. 
Q1: How does the system keep track of the connection between the string filename argv[i] passed to open(), 
and the resulting integer file descriptor fd?

After type cat in command line, System(OS) track the filename to integer fd by open syscall.
shell process fork and exec the new process cat.
cat's action decided by the arguments from shell.
- no argument: cat choose connect to fd0: keyboard.
- has arguments: cat open the file, and write to fd1: stdout - terminal.
In C code, system provide the abstrace syscall for code.
System designed by POSIX, abstract memory、CPU、storage to I/O、syscall、filesystem、process for program.

Q2: What does the integer file descriptor number refer to?
In POSIX:
- 0 stdin
- 1 stdout
- 2 stderr
- 3 opened file
- 4 another opened file
