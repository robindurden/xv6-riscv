Suppose that an xv6 kernel has used up all of the struct proc entries in the struct proc proc[NPROC] table (i.e., none of them have state == UNUSED). 

What happens if one of the processes calls exec()?
The process will loaded the file to replace it's old program, execed.

What happens if one of the processes calls fork()?
fork syscall fail

What happens if one of the processes calls kill() on an existing PID and then calls fork()?
the existing process will be released,then fork success.❌
kill() does not immediately free a struct proc.
If the killed process has not exited yet, fork() will still fail.
